# Git-Related Dotfiles

In lieu of the core dotfiles growing large and me being a Git power user, I
figured it made sense splitting it out into its own repository. This repository
would include things like the core configuration, aliases and binaries that
accelerate one's use of Git (or just mine).

## Types for Commit Message Format
  * feat: A new feature
  * fix: A bug fix
  * docs: Documentation only changes
  * style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
  * refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  * perf: A code change that improves performance
  * test: Adding missing tests
  * chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
